Introduction\n\nWe present DeepSeek-V3, a strong Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language model with 671B total parameters with 37B activated for each token. \nTo achieve efficient inference and cost-effective training, DeepSeek-V3 adopts Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and DeepSeekMoE architectures, which were thoroughly validated in DeepSeek-V2. \nFurthermore, DeepSeek-V3 pioneers an auxiliary-loss-free strategy for load balancing and sets a multi-token prediction training objective for stronger performance. \nWe pre-train DeepSeek-V3 on 14.8 trillion diverse and high-quality tokens, followed by Supervised Fine-Tuning and Reinforcement Learning stages to fully harness its capabilities. \nComprehensive evaluations reveal that DeepSeek-V3 outperforms other open-source models and achieves performance comparable to leading closed-source models.\nDespite its excellent performance, DeepSeek-V3 requires only 2.788M H800 GPU hours for its full training.\nIn addition, its training process is remarkably stable. \nThroughout the entire training process, we did not experience any irrecoverable loss spikes or perform any rollbacks. \n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img width=\"80%\" src=\"figures/benchmark.png\">\n</p>\n\n## 2. Model Summary\n\n---\n\n**Architecture: Innovative Load Balancing Strategy and Training Objective**\n\n- On top of the efficient architecture of DeepSeek-V2, we pioneer an auxiliary-loss-free strategy for load balancing, which minimizes the performance degradation that arises from encouraging load balancing.\n-  We investigate a Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) objective and prove it beneficial to model performance. \n    It can also be used for speculative decoding for inference acceleration. \n\n---\n\n**Pre-Training: Towards Ultimate Training Efficiency**\n\n- We design an FP8 mixed precision training framework and, for the first time, validate the feasibility and effectiveness of FP8 training on an extremely large-scale model.  \n- Through co-design of algorithms, frameworks, and hardware, we overcome the communication bottleneck in cross-node MoE training, nearly achieving full computation-communication overlap.  \n  This significantly enhances our training efficiency and reduces the training costs, enabling us to further scale up the model size without additional overhead.  \n- At an economical cost of only 2.664M H800 GPU hours, we complete the pre-training of DeepSeek-V3 on 14.8T tokens, producing the currently strongest open-source base model. The subsequent training stages after pre-training require only 0.1M GPU hours.\n\n---\n\n**Post-Training: Knowledge Distillation from DeepSeek-R1**\n\n-   We introduce an innovative methodology to distill reasoning capabilities from the long-Chain-of-Thought (CoT) model, specifically from one of the DeepSeek R1 series models, into standard LLMs, particularly DeepSeek-V3. Our pipeline elegantly incorporates the verification and reflection patterns of R1 into DeepSeek-V3 and notably improves its reasoning performance. Meanwhile, we also maintain a control over the output style and length of DeepSeek-V3.\n\n---\n\n\n## 3.

For step-by-step guidance, check out Section 6: [How_to Run_Locally](#6-how-to-run-locally).\n\nFor developers looking to dive deeper, we recommend exploring [README_WEIGHTS.md](./README_WEIGHTS.md) for details on the Main Model weights and the Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) Modules.

How to Run Locally\n\nDeepSeek-V3 can be deployed locally using the following hardware and open-source community software:\n\n1. **DeepSeek-Infer Demo**: We provide a simple and lightweight demo for FP8 and BF16 inference.\n2. **SGLang**: Fully support the DeepSeek-V3 model in both BF16 and FP8 inference modes, with Multi-Token Prediction [coming soon](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/issues/2591).\n3. **LMDeploy**: Enables efficient FP8 and BF16 inference for local and cloud deployment.\n4. **TensorRT-LLM**: Currently supports BF16 inference and INT4/8 quantization, with FP8 support coming soon.\n5. **vLLM**: Support DeepSeek-V3 model with FP8 and BF16 modes for tensor parallelism and pipeline parallelism.\n6. **LightLLM**: Supports efficient single-node or multi-node deployment for FP8 and BF16.\n7. **AMD GPU**: Enables running the DeepSeek-V3 model on AMD GPUs via SGLang in both BF16 and FP8 modes.\n8. **Huawei Ascend NPU**: Supports running DeepSeek-V3 on Huawei Ascend devices.\n\nSince FP8 training is natively adopted in our framework, we only provide FP8 weights. If you require BF16 weights for experimentation, you can use the provided conversion script to perform the transformation.\n\nHere is an example of converting FP8 weights to BF16:\n\n```shell\ncd inference\npython fp8_cast_bf16.py --input-fp8-hf-path /path/to/fp8_weights --output-bf16-hf-path /path/to/bf16_weights\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Hugging Face's Transformers has not been directly supported yet.\n\n### 6.1 Inference with DeepSeek-Infer Demo (example only)\n\n#### System Requirements\n\n> [!NOTE] \n> Linux with Python 3.10 only. Mac and Windows are not supported.\n\nDependencies:\n```pip-requirements\ntorch==2.4.1\ntriton==3.0.0\ntransformers==4.46.3\nsafetensors==0.4.5\n```\n#### Model Weights & Demo Code Preparation\n\nFirst, clone our DeepSeek-V3 GitHub repository:\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3.git\n```\n\nNavigate to the `inference` folder and install dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`. Easiest way is to use a package manager like `conda` or `uv` to create a new virtual environment and install the dependencies.\n\n```shell\ncd DeepSeek-V3/inference\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\nDownload the model weights from Hugging Face, and put them into `/path/to/DeepSeek-V3` folder.\n\n#### Model Weights Conversion\n\nConvert Hugging Face model weights to a specific format:\n\n```shell\npython convert.py --hf-ckpt-path /path/to/DeepSeek-V3 --save-path /path/to/DeepSeek-V3-Demo --n-experts 256 --model-parallel 16\n```\n\n#### Run\n\nThen you can chat with DeepSeek-V3:\n\n```shell\ntorchrun --nnodes 2 --nproc-per-node 8 --node-rank $RANK --master-addr $ADDR generate.py --ckpt-path /path/to/DeepSeek-V3-Demo --config configs/config_671B.json --interactive --temperature 0.7 --max-new-tokens 200\n```\n\nOr batch inference on a given file:\n\n```shell\ntorchrun --nnodes 2 --nproc-per-node 8 --node-rank $RANK --master-addr $ADDR generate.py --ckpt-path /path/to/DeepSeek-V3-Demo --config configs/config_671B.json --input-file $FILE\n```\n\n### 6.2 Inference with SGLang (recommended)\n\n[SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang) currently supports [MLA optimizations](https://lmsys.org/blog/2024-09-04-sglang-v0-3/#deepseek-multi-head-latent-attention-mla-throughput-optimizations), [DP Attention](https://lmsys.org/blog/2024-12-04-sglang-v0-4/#data-parallelism-attention-for-deepseek-models), FP8 (W8A8), FP8 KV Cache, and Torch Compile, delivering state-of-the-art latency and throughput performance among open-source frameworks.\n\nNotably, [SGLang v0.4.1](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/releases/tag/v0.4.1) fully supports running DeepSeek-V3 on both **NVIDIA and AMD GPUs**, making it a highly versatile and robust solution.\n\nSGLang also supports [multi-node tensor parallelism](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/tree/main/benchmark/deepseek_v3#example-serving-with-2-h208), enabling you to run this model on multiple network-connected machines.\n\nMulti-Token Prediction (MTP) is in development, and progress can be tracked in the [optimization plan](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/issues/2591).\n\nHere are the launch instructions from the SGLang team: https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/tree/main/benchmark/deepseek_v3\n\n### 6.3 Inference with LMDeploy (recommended)\n[LMDeploy](https://github.com/InternLM/lmdeploy), a flexible and high-performance inference and serving framework tailored for large language models, now supports DeepSeek-V3.
